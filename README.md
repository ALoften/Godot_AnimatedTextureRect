# Godot_AnimatedTextureRect
Animated Texture Rect for Godot


I will add documentation later, but long-story short...adjust the settings in the inspector. The inspector also has a variable that allows for editing the framerate. The spriteframes individual framerates are ignored. It wouldnt be hard to add this, I just dont care about it today but will likely come back to it another day.

This directly inherits the TextureRect node allowing you to still treat it the same as a textureRect. There is also a preview button in the inspector to start/stop the animation in the editor.The button should have no effect in game though.
